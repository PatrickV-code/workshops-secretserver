Secret Folder Structure
***********************

Before starting to add Secrets into Secret Server, it is essential that that a well-planned folder structure is created. A well planned, effective folder structure not only provides the ability to keep all secrets organized but it also allows for the effective use of security policies. 

| Security settings can be applied to individual secrets but with hundreds or thousands of secrets managing security on each secret does not scale. The way folder structures work in Secret Server is very similar to NTFS folder and file permissions in the Microsoft Windows world

| **Discussion Point:** At this point your trainer will discuss common approaches to planning your folder structure.

| In this module we will be creating a basic folder structure for the IT team and applying secret policies to the folder to ensure users only have access to Secrets they require in their role.
